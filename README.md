#### Free Tier 
Business model validation: the customer input their industry, problem statement, proposed solution (MVP), market segment, targeted customers => we will output stuff like pricing models, channels (scalable - content marketing, strategic marketing, etc.; non scalable - lead gen, blogging, twitter outreach, etc.) and advantages/disadvantages in comparison with the competitors

#### Paid Tier
The same customer input but this time we will do thorough analytics on the customer's competitors, build target customers' profiles (TCP), perform testing & quality control (MVP experiments) and MOST IMPORTANTLY, automated lead gen service
